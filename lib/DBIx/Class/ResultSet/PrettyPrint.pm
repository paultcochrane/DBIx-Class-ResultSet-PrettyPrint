=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ever wanted to quickly visualise what a C<DBIx::Class> result set looks like
(for instance, in tests) without having to resort to reproducing the query
in SQL in a DBMS REPL?  This is what this module does: it pretty prints
result sets wherever you are, be it in tests or within a debugging session.

While searching for such a solution, I stumbled across L<an answer on
StackOverflow|https://stackoverflow.com/a/4072923/10874800> and thought:
that would be nice as a module.  And so here it is.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 print_table( $result_set )

Print the "table" from the given result set.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I borrowed heavily upon the test structure used in
L<https://github.com/davidolrik/DBIx-Class-FormTools> for the test database
setup and creation.
