# DBIx-Class-ResultSet-PrettyPrint - pretty print DBIC result sets

This is a very simple module to pretty print [DBIx::Class::ResultSet
objects](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::ResultSet).

## SYNOPSIS

```perl
use DBIx::Class::ResultSet::PrettyPrint;
use Schema;  # load your DBIx::Class schema

# load your database and fetch a result set
my $schema = Schema->connect( 'dbi:SQLite:books.db' );
my $books = $schema->resultset( 'Book' );

# pretty print the result set
my $pp = DBIx::Class::ResultSet::PrettyPrint->new();
$pp->print_table( $books );

## DESCRIPTION

Ever wanted to quickly visualise what a `DBIx::Class` result set looks like
(for instance, in tests) without having to resort to reproducing the query
in SQL in a DBMS REPL?  This is what this module does: it pretty prints
result sets wherever you are, be it in tests or within a debugging session.

While searching for such a solution, I stumbled across [an answer on
StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4072923/10874800) and thought:
that would be nice as a module.  And so here it is.

```
